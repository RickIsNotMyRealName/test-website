# Agent Instructions

This repository powers the Mount View Ventures website using the **Titan Core** Astro theme. Before working on any content, read `README.md` for an overview of the theme features and project structure. Key company information (mission, vision, services, taglines and design notes) lives under `information/`. Use these files when writing or updating pages so that the messaging stays consistent.

Highlights from the company information:

- Vision: _"to be a trusted leader in the construction and renovation industry, delivering affordable, high-quality housing and property improvements that enhance lives and strengthen communities."_
- Mission: _"building strong communities through quality craftsmanship, innovative designs and cost-effective solutions."_
- Services include renovations, new construction, overhead doors and roll shutters, concrete work, decks and fencing.
- Suggested colours: **Black**, **White** and **Silver**.
- Taglines such as **"Building Quality Spaces, Enhancing Livesâ€”Inside, Outside, and All Around."** help guide marketing tone.

When customizing the site, refer to the Titan Core theming options documented in `README.md`. Choose a theme in `src/data/config.ts` or remove the theme switcher for a single consistent style. Content lives under `src/content/` and configuration files are stored in `src/data/`.
